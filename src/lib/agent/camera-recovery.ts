/**
 * @module agent/camera-recovery
 * @description Single forward-permissive parser for the agent's air-side
 * USB camera recovery block. Shared by the LAN-direct full-status mapper,
 * the cloud heartbeat extras builder, and the capability-store normalizer
 * so the clamp rules never drift across the three ingest paths.
 *
 * The block is dropped entirely when `state` is absent or not one of the
 * known recovery states; the numeric and boolean fields are coerced
 * defensively so a single malformed heartbeat can never throw.
