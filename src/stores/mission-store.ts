/**
 * @module mission-store
 * @description Zustand store for mission waypoint state and mission
 * upload/download via the drone protocol abstraction.
 *
 * Undo/redo is no longer waypoint-local. Every operator mutation records ONE
 * combined snapshot into the coordinated planner history (`planner-history`),
 * which spans waypoints, the geofence, rally points, and drawn shapes, so a
 * single Ctrl+Z reverts the last planner action regardless of which domain it
 * touched. This store registers the waypoint half of that snapshot at module
 * init and routes its own ``undo()`` / ``redo()`` entry points (still used by the
 * keyboard dispatcher) through the shared timeline.
