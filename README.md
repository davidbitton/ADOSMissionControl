## What ADOS Mission Control Is

- **Platform:** Browser-based. Runs on any OS with a modern browser. Optional Electron desktop build for WebSerial + WebUSB access.
- **Firmware:** ArduPilot, PX4, Betaflight, and iNav as first-class targets.
- **Protocol:** MAVLink v2 + MSP v1/v2 in the same app via a unified `DroneProtocol` adapter interface.
- **Flight control:** Gamepad, HOTAS, RC transmitter, or keyboard input at 50 Hz.
- **AI tuning:** PID + filter analysis with FFT-driven noise and motor-health diagnosis.
- **3D simulation:** CesiumJS globe with real terrain and flight path replay.
- **Fleet mode:** MQTT + Convex relay for multi-drone dashboards. Self-hostable end to end.
- **License:** GPL-3.0-only.

## What It Does

### Configure your flight controller

49 panels covering calibration, PID tuning, receiver, outputs, failsafe, power, ports, OSD, firmware flashing, plus 13 iNav-specific panels for safehomes, geozones, navigation config, profiles, output mapping, servos, temp sensors, MC braking, rate dynamics, and mission summary. Works with ArduPilot, PX4, Betaflight, and iNav. **AI PID tuning** analyzes FFT noise and motor health, then suggests filter settings and PID values. Board auto-detection for 9 STM32 profiles. WebUSB firmware flashing with no external tools.

### Plan missions

Drag waypoints on an interactive map. 7 pattern generators: survey (boustrophedon), orbit, corridor, SAR (expanding square, sector, parallel track), structure scan. Terrain following via Open Elevation API. Geofence editor, rally points, batch waypoint editing, and mission validation before upload. Import/export KML, KMZ, CSV, `.waypoints`, `.plan`.

### Fly and simulate

Gamepad, HOTAS, RC transmitter, or keyboard input at 50Hz. Arm/disarm, mode switching, guided flight, mission execution, kill switch. 3D Cesium globe simulation with real terrain, flight path replay, and camera presets.

### Monitor telemetry

Real-time attitude, GPS, battery, EKF status, vibration, RSSI, and sensor health. Pre-arm check visualization. Alert feed from the flight controller. Ring-buffered stores keep memory bounded across long sessions.

### Sign MAVLink commands

HMAC-SHA256 on every outbound MAVLink v2 frame. The 32-byte key lives only in your browser as a non-extractable Web Crypto key and is enrolled with the flight controller once via `SETUP_SIGNING`. Flip require mode from the Configure tab Security panel to make the flight controller reject any unsigned command. ArduPilot 4.0 and newer supported today. See [docs](https://docs.altnautica.com/mission-control/mavlink-signing).

### Connect over the cloud

Works standalone in field mode (direct WebSocket or WebSerial). Cloud mode adds fleet management, mission sync, and MQTT telemetry relay. When paired with ADOS Drone Agent, the GCS receives live telemetry at 2Hz+ and can send commands through a three-layer relay: Convex HTTP (baseline), MQTT real-time, and WebSocket video streaming.

### Manage a ground station

When the paired agent is running in ground-station profile, a Hardware tab appears with sub-views for Network (uplink priority and AP management), Distributed RX (single-node link stats, relay list, combined stream stats), Mesh (batman-adv health, neighbors, gateways, pairing accept window, pending approvals), Physical UI (OLED screens and button mappings), Peripherals (connected USB and GPIO hardware), and Controllers (paired joysticks and gamepads). A role badge sits in the top bar at all times so operators can see at a glance whether a paired node is running as `direct`, `relay`, or `receiver`. Mesh events (neighbor seen, neighbor lost, gateway change, pair approved) surface as non-blocking toasts.

## Firmware Support

| Firmware | Protocol | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| ArduPilot (Copter / Plane / Rover / Sub) | MAVLink v2 | Full |
| PX4 | MAVLink v2 | Full |
| Betaflight | MSP v1/v2 | Full |
| iNav | MSP v1/v2 | Full |

---

## By the Numbers

~98K lines of TypeScript. 38 FC panels. 83 MAVLink decoders. 34 MSP decoders. 7 pattern generators. 34 Zustand stores. 9 board profiles. Full demo mode with zero setup.

---

## Platform Support

| Platform | Requirements | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Web (recommended) | Chrome 89+ or Edge 89+ | WebSerial + WebUSB for FC connection and firmware flashing |
| Web (limited) | Firefox, Safari | No WebSerial or WebUSB. WebSocket connections work. |

| Desktop (Windows) | x64 | Electron app, `.exe` installer |
| Desktop (Linux) | x64 or arm64 | `.AppImage` |

3D features (simulation, air traffic) benefit from a dedicated GPU. Works without one but frame rates will be lower.

---

## External Services

All optional. The GCS works fully offline for local FC configuration and field operations.

|---------|---------|-----------|
| [Convex](https://convex.dev) | Cloud fleet management, auth, community features | No (field mode works without) |
| [Open Elevation](https://open-elevation.com) | Terrain following for mission planning | No (defaults to flat terrain) |
| [Cesium Ion](https://cesium.com/ion) | 3D terrain tiles and satellite imagery | No (uses ArcGIS terrain by default) |
| [Groq](https://console.groq.com) | AI PID tuning analysis | No (AI features disabled without key) |
| [GitHub API](https://github.com) | PX4 firmware release fetching | No (raises rate limit from 60 to 5000/hr) |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|

## Connecting to Hardware

**WebSocket:** Connect to any MAVLink-over-WebSocket endpoint. Use `npm run cli sitl` to launch ArduPilot SITL with the bridge tool. See [`tools/sitl/`](tools/sitl/).

**WebSerial (USB):** Plug in your FC, open Mission Control in Chrome 89+, click connect, pick the port. No drivers needed.

---

## Desktop App

```bash
npm run desktop:build:mac   # macOS .dmg
npm run desktop:build:win   # Windows .exe installer
npm run desktop:build:linux # Linux .AppImage
```

macOS: right-click the app, Open, then Open again. Not code-signed, same as Betaflight Configurator and INAV Configurator.

---

## Backend and Cloud Features

Field mode works with no backend. Cloud features need a Convex deployment:

```bash
npx convex init
npx @convex-dev/auth
npx convex dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local`. The first user to sign up becomes admin.

For self-hosted MQTT and video relay, run `npm run cli prod` for a guided wizard (port selection, conflict detection, config file generation, optional service start), or follow the manual steps in [SELFHOSTING.md](SELFHOSTING.md). Source for each service: [`tools/mqtt-bridge/`](tools/mqtt-bridge/), [`tools/video-relay/`](tools/video-relay/).

### Environment variables (`.env.local`)

All variables are optional. Set them with `npm run cli config` or edit `.env.local` directly. The file is gitignored and never committed.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` | Enable demo mode with simulated drones |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_DRONE_COUNT` | Number of simulated drones (1, 3, 5, or 10) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | Convex backend URL for cloud fleet features |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Raises PX4 releases API limit from 60 to 5000 req/hr |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | AI PID tuning suggestions. Free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| `CESIUM_BASE_URL` | Self-hosted Cesium JS URL (falls back to CDN if unset) |

### Tools

| Tool | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| SITL launcher | `tools/sitl/` | ArduPilot SITL + TCP-to-WebSocket bridge |
| MQTT bridge | `tools/mqtt-bridge/` | Mosquitto broker + MQTT-to-Convex bridge (Docker Compose) |
